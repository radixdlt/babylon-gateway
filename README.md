# RadixDLT Network Gateway

This system is designed to be the Radix-run publicly exposed gateway into the Olympia Radix network, and replaces the archive module which previously ran on-node.

The system is in two main parts:
* **Data Aggregator** - Reads from the Core API of one or more full nodes, ingesting from their Transaction API and Mempool Contents API, and committing transactions to a PostgreSQL database. It also handles the pruning (and resubmission where relevant) of submitted transactions. This project has ownership of the schema migrations.
* **Gateway API** - Provides the public API for Wallets and Explorers, and maps construction and submission requests to the Core API of one or more full nodes.

## Using the Gateway API

For documentation on the Gateway API, see the [Gateway API docs on ReDocly](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-network-gateway/main/gateway-api-spec.yaml).
