## 1.7.0
Release built: _not released yet_

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking Changes:**
> - `/stream/transactions` no longer indexes `affected_global_entities` for the transaction tracker and the consensus manager entity types.
> - Changed `variant_id` of `ProgrammaticScryptoSborValueEnum` from numeric (`type: integer`) to string-encoded numeric (`type: string`) to make it compatible with the rest of the ecosystem.

### Bug fixes
- Properly indexes manifest classes. Some transactions might have been previously misclassified as `Transfer` and `AccountDepositSettingsUpdate`, i.e. empty transactions with only `lock_fee` instruction.

### API Changes
- Added support for the missing `message` and `flags.disable_auth_checks` properties in the `/transaction/preview` endpoint request.
- Added list of mutable non fungible data fields `non_fungible_data_mutable_fields` returned from `/state/entity/details` endpoint.
- New `event_global_emitters_filter` filter added to `/stream/transactions` endpoint. It allows filtering transactions by the global ancestor of an event emitter. For events emitted by a global entity it is going to be that entity, for internal entities it is going to be a global ancestor.
- Changed `variant_id` of `ProgrammaticScryptoSborValueEnum` from numeric (`type: integer`) to string-encoded numeric (`type: string`) to make it compatible with the rest of the ecosystem.
- Optimized `/statistics/validators/uptime` endpoint processing time.

### Database changes
- Replaced relationship-related columns (`*_entity_id`) in the `entities` table with more generic collection implementation using `correlated_entity_*` columns.
- Replaced per-epoch validator emissions (`validator_emission_statistics` table) with their cumulative statistics (`validator_cumulative_emission_history` table).
- Added `non_fungible_data_mutable_fields` to `entities` table. Which contains list of all mutable non fungible data fields for non fungible resource entities.
- New `ledger_transaction_markers` type with the `event_global_emitter` discriminator. It represents the global emitter for each event.

## 1.6.1
Release built: 21.05.2024

### API Changes
- Added `well_known_addresses.locker_package` address property to the `/status/network-configuration` endpoint response.
- Added a new endpoint `/state/account-locker/page/vaults` which allows to read all resource vaults for a given AccountLocker.
- Added a new endpoint `/state/account-lockers/touched-at` which allows to read last touch state version for a given collection of AccountLockers.

### Database changes
- Added a new set of AccountLocker-related tables: `account_locker_entry_definition`, `account_locker_entry_resource_vault_definition` and `account_locker_entry_touch_history`.
- Added two new columns `account_locker_of_account_entity_id` and `account_locker_of_account_locker_entity_id` to the `entities` table filled for AccountLocker-related Vaults and KeyValueStores.
- Changed `IX_entity_vault_history_vault_entity_id_from_state_version` index to match all existing vaults rather non-fungible ones only.

## 1.5.2
Release built: 14.05.2024

- Fixed broken Core API SDK

## 1.5.1
Release built: 09.05.2024

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking Changes:**
> - Changed ordering of the collection returned by the `/state/key-value-store/keys` endpoint. Entries are no longer orderer by their last modification state version but rather by their first appearance on the network, descending.
> - Property `total_count` of the `/state/key-value-store/keys` endpoint is no longer provided.
> - Renamed `state.recovery_role_recovery_attempt` property from `timed_recovery_allowed_after` to `allow_timed_recovery_after` returned from `/state/entity/details` when querying for access controller.

- Fixed broken ledger state lookup (`at_ledger_state`) when using epoch-only constraint and given epoch did not result in any transactions at round `1`.
- Fixed broken (missing) package blueprint & code, and schema pagination in the `/state/entity/details` endpoint.
- Fixed unstable package blueprint and code aggregation where changes could overwrite each other if they applied to the same blueprint/package within the same ingestion batch.
- Fixed validator public key and active set aggregation where unnecessary copy of the key was stored on each epoch change.
- Fixed pagination of the `/state/validators/list` endpoint where incorrect `cursor` was generated previously.
- Fixed invalid date-time format for some entity state properties (most notably access controllers and their `recovery_role_recovery_attempt.allow_timed_recovery_after.date_time` property) that was dependent on OS-level locale setup.
- Added `ng_workers_global_loop_duration_seconds` and `ng_workers_node_loop_duration_seconds` histogram metrics measuring the time it took to process a single iteration of a given worker.
- Changed MVC controller and action names. It has no effect on the API itself, but alters prometheus `controler` and `action` labels.
  - `StateKeyValueStoreController.Items` renamed to `StateKeyValueStoreController.KeysPage`,
  - `StateNonFungibleController.Ids` renamed to `StateNonFungibleController.IdsPage`,
  - `StatisticsController.Uptime` renamed to `StatisticsController.ValidatorsUptime`,
  - `StateController` renamed to `StateEntityController`,
  - `ValidatorStateController` renamed to `StateValidatorsComponent`.
- Upgraded to .NET 8:
  - Upgraded runtime and libraries
  - Dockerfiles no longer specify custom `app` user as it comes built-in with official base images.
  - Removed now-obsolete or no-longer-needed code.
  - Prometheus integration exposes new built-in metric `httpclient_request_duration_seconds_bucket` for all registered HTTP clients.
- Reworked internal data aggregation mechanism to ease up maintenance burden.
- Reworked KVStores storage and changed API surface of this area to improve overall performance. 

### API Changes
- Changed the `MetadataInstantValue` type and its array counterpart `MetadataInstantArrayValue` to clamp the `value` property within the RFC-3339 compatible date-time year range `1583` to `9999`. Added a `unix_timestamp_seconds` property to these types to give the exact unclamped numerical timestamp value.
- Added `role_assignments` property to the `StateEntityDetailsResponsePackageDetails`. All global component details returned by the `/state/entity/details` endpoint contain role assignments now.
- Added `owning_vault_parent_ancestor_address` and `owning_vault_global_ancestor_address` properties to the response of the `/state/non-fungible/location` endpoint.
- Added new filter `manifest_badges_presented_filter` to the `/stream/transactions` endpoint which allows filtering transactions by badges presented. 
- Added new opt-in `component_royalty_config` to the `/state/entity/details` endpoint. When enabled `royalty_config` will be returned for each component.
- Use strong type definition for the `royalty_config` property of package blueprint and general components details. This is a change to OAS definition only and does not impact returned data format.
- Introduced upper limit to the overall number of the filters used in the `/stream/transactions` endpoint, defaults to 10.
- Added new endpoint `/state/account/page/resource-preferences` which allows to read resource preferences for given account.
- Added new endpoint `/state/account/page/authorized-depositors` which allows to read authorized depositors for given account.
- Added new endpoint `/state/package/page/blueprints` returning paginable iterator over package blueprints.
- Added new endpoint `/state/package/page/codes` returning paginable iterator over package codes.
- Added new endpoint `/state/entity/page/schemas` returning paginable iterator over entity schemas.
- Added new endpoint `/transaction/account-deposit-pre-validation` which allows to pre-validate if deposits can succeed based on account deposit settings and badges presented, before submitting the transaction. 
- Fixed wrong request validation logic for maximum number of items in `/state/non-fungible/data`, `/state/non-fungible/data` and `/state/non-fungible/data` endpoints.
- `limit_per_page` request parameter is no longer validated against `*MaxPageSize` API configuration parameters. In case requested limit exceeds API configuration maximum value is used. This change is meant to reduce clients need to understand and honor API configuration. 

### Database changes
- Added new `BadgePresented` to `LedgerTransactionMarkerOperationType` enum and started collecting transaction markers for badges presented in transactions.
- Column `royalty_amount` of `component_method_royalty_entry_history` table contains now the JSON payload representing the royalty amount without wrapping object.
- Changed schema area:
    - renamed `schema_history` table to `schema_entry_definition`,
    - introduced `schema_entry_aggregate_history` table that contains aggregate history of schema entries under given entity.
- Changed KVStore area:
  - dropped `key_value_store_aggregate_history` table altogether as we no longer keep track of aggregated KVStores,
  - introduced `key_value_store_entry_definition` table that defines each and every KVStore entry,
  - table `key_value_store_entry_history` references rows from `key_value_store_entry_definition` rather `key`s themselves.

## 1.4.4
Release built: 27.03.2024

### API Changes
- Improved performance `/stream/transactions` endpoint when using `manifest_class_filter` filter.

### Database changes
- Replaced `IX_ledger_transaction_markers_manifest_class_is_most_specific_~` index with two separate indexes `IX_ledger_transaction_markers_manifest_class_is_most_specific` (indexes `is_most_specific` = true only) and `IX_ledger_transaction_markers_manifest_class` (indexes all manifest classes).

## 1.4.3
Release built: 06.03.2024

### Bug fixes
- Properly indexes key value store keys in `key_value_store_entry_history` and `key_value_store_aggregate_history` tables. Previously it was possible that if the key was updated multiple times in one processed transaction batch some updates might not be indexed properly. This release fixes those issues and makes sure they are properly indexed and each change is properly returned from `/state/key-value-store/keys` and `/state/key-value-store/keys` endpoints.

## 1.4.1
Release built: 27.02.2024

### Bug fixes
- Recreated key value store keys are properly returned from `/state/key-value-store/keys` and `/state/key-value-store/data`. Previously Gateway did not return keys that were deleted and then recreated. This release fixes existing data in the database and makes sure new ingested data is properly stored in the database.

## 1.4.0
Release built: 08.02.2024

- Dropped internal `balance_changes` fallback mechanism. As of right now this information is ingested as part of regular transaction ingestion process.
- Reworked internal mechanism used to fetch network configuration. Is no longer stored in the underlying database and it is shared across all services.
- Reworked (partially) internal mechanism used to ingest ledger data by Data Aggregator to improve maintainability and simplify future extensions.
- Fixed `state_version`-based ledger state `at_ledger_state`/`from_ledger_state` constraints which could result in inaccurate lookups previously. Attempt to read from non-existent state version will result in HTTP 400 Bad Request. Previously the nearest state version would be used.

### API Changes
- Return components effective role assignments only for assigned modules.
- Added new filters for the `/stream/transactions` endpoint: `accounts_with_manifest_owner_method_calls`, `accounts_without_manifest_owner_method_calls` and `manifest_class_filter`.
- Extended response models returned by `/transaction/committed-details` and `/stream/transactions` endpoints:
    - added `manifest_instructions` optional property and a corresponding opt-in for returning original manifest of user transactions,
    - added optional `manifest_classes` property: a collection of zero or more manifest classes ordered from the most specific class to the least specific one.
- Added `permanently_rejects_at_epoch` to `/transaction/status` response for pending transactions.
- Added new endpoint `/state/key-value-store/keys/` that allows iterating over `KeyValueStore` keys.

### Database changes
- Created new `key_value_store_aggregate_history` table which will hold pointers to all key_value_store keys.
- Dropped `network_configuration` table.
- Fixed component's method royalty aggregation, added missing `component_method_royalty_aggregate_history` table.
- Changed `IX_validator_emission_statistics_validator_entity_id_epoch_num~` index to include `proposals_made` and `proposals_missed` columns in order to optimize `/statistics/validators/update` endpoint.

### Deprecations
- Obsoleted incorrectly named `access_rules_package` in favor of `role_assignment_module_package` on `NetworkConfigurationResponse.well_known_addresses`. Obsoleted property will contain effective copy of the new one for backwards compability.

## 1.3.0
Release built: 29.01.2024

Adds support for protocol updates (in general) and the anemone update in particular.

### API Changes

- Adds support for a new transaction type (flash transactions) that occur during protocol updates.
- Extends well known addresses returned from `/status/network-configuration` to include the transaction tracker address.
- **DEPRECATION** - Obsoletes the `vm_type`, `code_hash_hex` and `code_hex` properties of `StateEntityDetailsResponsePackageDetails` in favor of the `codes` collection. With the upcoming protocol upgrade it will be possible to have multiple codes per package. The obsoleted properties will contain an effective copy of the first element of the new collection for backwards compability.

### Database changes

- Moves `vm_type` to `package_code_history` table from package in `entity` table.
- Creates new `package_blueprint_aggregate_history` table which will hold pointers to all package blueprints.
- Creates new `package_code_aggregate_history` table which will hold pointers to all package codes.

## 1.2.5
Release built: 26.01.2024

- Fixed broken (incompatible) Core API SDK

## 1.2.4
Release built: 4.01.2024

- Extended validator's data returned from `/state/validators/list`: added `effective_fee_factor` field which returns `current` fee_factor and optionally `pending` change.
- Enable retries on transient database connectivity issues in gateway api.
- Enable retries on core api calls in gateway api.
- Optimized transaction balance changes; if available they're read from internal database, otherwise they use existing fallback mechanism

## 1.2.3
Release built: 19.12.2023

- Fixed exception thrown on empty validator set in the `/state/validator/list` endpoint.
- `524` status code returned instead of `500` if request takes longer than configured timeout.
- Validate if addresses provided in requests to API belong to network it is running on. 
- Fixed `500` status code returned from `/transaction/submit` when Transaction got committed before Gateway was able to store pending transaction node submission result. It'll return 200 status code from now on and log exception as information.

## 1.2.2
Release built: 22.11.2023

- Fixed invalid foreign key between `pending_transactions` and `pending_transaction_payloads` tables.
- Fixed package detail lookups to return all the blueprints and schemas.
- Optimized transaction balance changes fetch time (parallelized).

## 1.2.1 
Release built: 06.11.2023

- Fixed local development environment setup.
- Fixed missing `state` property on non-global entity state details.

## 1.2.0
Release built: 27.10.2023

- Added more strongly-typed OAS definitions for `programmatic_json` and types derived from the Core API.
- Added `resource_address` to fungible and non-fungible vault entity details in the `/state/entity/details` endpoint.
- Fixed `epoch [+ round]` based ledger state lookups.
- Fixed vault collection ordering for newly ingested data. A database wipe might be required, see information below.
- Fixed non-persisted identity/account lookups.

*Warning* This release contains a fix for a non-critical bug in the data ingestion mechanism where resource vaults were not ordered correctly by last change descending. Already ingested data will remain with the old ordering, i.e. the bugfix will only affect newly ingested data. If this matters to you, you will need to resync your database from scratch.

## 1.1.0
Release built: ~20.10.2023~ (scrapped)

- Fixed invalid HTTP status code on input validation failure.
- Changed default configuration value of MaxPageSize for endpoints to 100. Validate if max page size is higher than DefaultPageSize.
- Added new opt-in `balance_changes` to `/transaction/committed-details` returning resource balance changes for a given transaction.
- Added new opt-in `receipt_output` to `/stream/transactions`, and `/transaction/committed-details` endpoints. Temporarily set by default to true, to allow client's migration.
- Added vault-related details to lookups in `/state/entity/details` endpoint.  
- Optimized `TransactionQuerier.GetTransactions` not to fetch unnecessary data from underlying database.
- Added strongly-typed OAS definition for `programmatic_json`.
- Tuned documentation and constraints of various OAS type definitions.

## 1.0.1 
Release built: 10.10.2023

- Fixed missing `RecordTopOfDbLedger` observer call in `LedgerTransactionsProcessor`.
- Fixed invalid response model for HTTP 400 Bad Request responses on input parameter validation failure.
- Return 400 with validation error instead of 500 if `from_ledger_state` `state_version` is beyond known ledger tip.

## 1.0.0 - Babylon Launch
Release built: 28.09.2023

### What’s new?
- log warning if sql query takes longer than configured threshold (default to 250ms) for both entity framework and dapper queries.
- gather execution time metrics for all sql queries (both entity framework and dapper).

## 1.0.0-rc3 - Babylon Launch (Release Candidate 3)
Release built: Friday 22nd September 2023

### Breaking changes
- Instead of returning only the event data payload from `/stream/transactions` and `/transaction/committed-details`, the event data is now a complex object, wrapping the data payload, but also containing the emitter and event name. This allows you to properly determine which entity emitted the event.

### What’s new?
- Fixed `epoch` in `from_state_version` forward querying for migrated environments where lowest epoch number isn't 1. 
- Fixed the `validator_active_set_history` table which contains data about validator active set history. It was wrongly attached to future epoch not current one.
- Pending transaction handling has been reworked, and `/transaction/status` returns some additional fields with a lot more information regarding the status of the intent and submitted payloads. Check out the `intent_status` and `payload_status` fields. Each status is also associated with a description to help developers understand the meaning of the returned status.

## 0.5.5 RCNet v3.1 revision 4
Release built: 18.09.2023

- fix `/state/entity/details` endpoint when querying for multiple components with same schema.

- Add `non_fungible_id_location_history` table to improve NFID lookup performance.
- Add missing index to `entity_vault_history` table to improve royalty vault lookup performance.

## 0.5.3 RCNet v3.1 revision 2
Release built: 13.09.2023

- Fix incomplete entity type mapping.
- Fix non-fungible resource aggregation.
- Add `key_json` property to `StateKeyValueStoreDataRequestKeyItem` enabling JSON-based KVStore lookup.
- support remote schema assignment for generic (key value store, non fungible data) substitution.

## 0.5.2 RCNet v3.1
Release built: 07.09.2023

### What’s New?
- Add `from_state_version` to `validator_emission_statistics`.
- Returning all possible role assignment keys in `main` module for all entity types (previously only for fungible and non fungible resources).
- Fixed broken pagination for NFIDs under `/state/entity/details` and `/state/entity/page/non-fungible-vaults` endpoints.
- Fixed invalid `index_in_epoch` and `index_in_round` for genesis TX.
- Fixed virtual identity and account details.
- Fixed how TX total fee paid is calculated.

## 0.5.1 RCNet v3 revision 2
Release built: 01.09.2023

- Fix data aggregator processing custom events.

# 0.5.0 - RCNet v3
Release built: 31.08.2023

## RCNet v2 to RCNet v3 Migration Guide

Fixes for the following issues:
- [#96](https://github.com/radixdlt/babylon-gateway/issues/96) - "Paging through the NonFungibleIds of a resource does not work properly" thank you `backyard-coder`!
- Incorrect calculation of balances when there are multiple vaults in a component. (Note - NFIds are still incorrectly tracked if spread across multiple vaults - this will be fixed as part of a schema overhaul)
- Fungible resource metadata is updated properly
